                Prep: To begin with, always start putting your makeup on a fresh
                and clean canvas. This means that you should always wash your
                face and clear out any residue with a good cleansing water or
                lotion to start right like the SUGAR Swipe Right Cleansing
                Water. For a true glow-from-within look, make sure you follow
                this up with a sheet mask that helps your skin feel supple and
                smooth. Once the face is set, choose from SUGAR’s collection of
                face primers, which will help keep your makeup in place for a
                long period of time. A little goes a long way with a pea-sized
                amount of primer that acts as a skin-perfector, creating the
                definition of a flawless base whilst blurring out wrinkles and
                fine lines. According to your skin time, you can choose a
                mattifying face primer or a hydrating face primer.
